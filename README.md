Project to make a fast food combo calculator, to find the best value combo available, within your price range, brand choice, etc. Currently there is a NextJS website version that has been discontinued, and a local version which is the main version. Use the calculator by opening index.html, creating a new list, and putting in your filters or inputting combos that aren't already present, or editing details of existing ones. Your lists save locally on your device, and can be imported or exported.
